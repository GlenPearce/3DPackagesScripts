///Why this add ons? ///

Move Pivot was made to easily move the pivot points on models. Comming from Maya, I wanted a similar way to move the pivot as I also use this point to snap the model to other meshes.
Also when looking up originally how to move the pivot in default Blender, it seemed pretty long-winded when I was expecting just a single hotkey.


///How to use ///

Move Pivot - Once installed, be sure to set a suitable shortcut (default is '=' key). To do this, on Blender go to Object drop down menu in the top left > Right click on move pivot, change shortcut.
by default, it will snap to vertex and middle points of an edge, this can be changed by editing the snap elements on line 26 (will make UI in the future to prevent having to edit the script!)
You can then move just the pivot as you would a mesh, using either the gizmo or the transform hotkey 'G'.


///How to install Blender addons! ///

Load up Blender, go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons and then click Install in the top left of the window. 
Locate the .py file on your PC and confirm. Ensure the check box is ticked on the add-on window.
