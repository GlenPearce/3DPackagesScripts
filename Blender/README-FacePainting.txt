///Why this add ons? ///

Currently on a new project and the art uses a line shader which takes into account the different in vertex colours from face neighbours.
In Blender, it felt a bit long winded to do in vertex painting mode, and you don't have access to select linked tools like in edit mode.
This allows the user to apply vertex colours straight in edit mode to faces. Would recommend creating a material to see the vertex colour data.

This add-on also creates a vertex colour data layer if one doesn't exsist.


///How to use ///

Once installed, select your object (must be a single object) and go into edit mode. Select a number of faces then choose which colour button from the panel to apply.


///How to install Blender addons! ///

Load up Blender, go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons and then click Install in the top left of the window. 
Locate the .py file on your PC and confirm. Ensure the check box is ticked on the add-on window.
